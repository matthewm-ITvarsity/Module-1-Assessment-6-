   <strong><h1>Description</h1></strong>
   <pre>
     <h2>
      The next generation of PlayStation is finally here with the arrival of the PS5. This generation, it seems like Sony is sticking with the approach that
       made the PS4 so successful: sell consoles that can play first-party games from Sony’s storied franchises, and supplement that lineup with great third-party titles, too.
       You should expect to see better graphics in your games, and the PS5 will also support high refresh rates, which should make games feel smoother.
       Plus, the PS5’s custom SSD promises to offer such a leap forward in loading speeds that it could change the way games are designed.
